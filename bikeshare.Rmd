This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv("fordGoBikeFinal.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

data2 <- na.omit(data)
head(data2)
```

```{r}
df2 <- data2[,c("index","duration","lat","lon","lat.end","lon.end","bike.id","user.type","member.birth.year","member.gender","distance.km")]
df3 <- na.omit(df2)
head(df2)

```



```{r}
# VIM library for using 'aggr'
library(VIM)

# 'aggr' plots the amount of missing/imputed values in each column
aggr(df2)
```


```{r}
df4 <- df3[,c("duration","distance.km")]
head(df3)
#Elbow Method for finding the optimal number of clusters
set.seed(50)
# Compute and plot wss for k = 2 to k = 15.
k.max <- 12
wss <- sapply(1:k.max, 
              function(k){kmeans(df4, k, nstart=50,iter.max = 15 )$tot.withinss})
wss
wss1 <- plot(1:k.max, wss,
        type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE, 
        xlab="Number of clusters K",
        ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")

```

```{r}
set.seed(50)
clusters <- kmeans(df4[,c("duration","distance.km")], 3)

# Save the cluster number in the dataset as column 'Rider_Type'
df4$Rider_Type <- as.factor(clusters$cluster)

library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)
str(clusters)
autoplot(clusters, data = df2)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
